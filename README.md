# Pipe and Filters

This repository contains the Python code of an application that implements the Pipes and Filters pattern. It takes a directory as input and concurrently produces the following information:

* Age and illness
* Doctor and patient
* Illness and invoice
* Illness and season (time)
* Insurance and patient
* Illness and sex

The application generates the frequency and mean of this data. This is used to generate histogram and Pie charts which are saved on a folder in the same patch where the app executer is.
